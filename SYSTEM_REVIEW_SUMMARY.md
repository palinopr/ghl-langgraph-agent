# System Review Summary - Trace 1f067f7c-90e1-6b5f-9070-0011f54194b7

## What I Found

### Main Issue: Context Mismatch
- **Customer said**: "tengo un restaurante y estoy perdiendo clientes" (I have a restaurant and I'm losing customers)
- **System responded**: About WhatsApp automation for Main Outlet Media
- **Root cause**: System hardcoded for WhatsApp automation sales only

### Other Observations
1. **Workflow executed correctly**: thread_mapper → receptionist → smart_router → maria → responder
2. **No errors or crashes**: All nodes completed successfully
3. **No message duplication**: Clean message flow
4. **Debug features present**: But not showing in this specific trace

## What I Fixed

### 1. Added Business Context Configuration
```python
# New settings in app/config.py
COMPANY_NAME="Your Company"
SERVICE_TYPE="your service"
SERVICE_DESCRIPTION="what you offer"
TARGET_PROBLEM="problems you solve"
ADAPT_TO_CUSTOMER=true  # Magic setting!
```

### 2. Made Maria Adaptive
- Now detects when customers mention restaurants, food service, losing customers
- Adapts her response to focus on customer retention instead of WhatsApp
- Uses configuration settings but can override based on context

### 3. Enhanced Smart Router
- Analyzes "customer conversation" instead of "WhatsApp conversation"
- Extracts ACTUAL customer problems, not assumed problems
- Added problem_match field to check alignment

### 4. Created Test Script
- `test_adaptive_context.py` - Tests different business scenarios
- Verifies system adapts to restaurant vs generic business contexts

## How to Use

### For Restaurant/Hospitality Clients
```bash
export COMPANY_NAME="Restaurant Solutions Inc"
export SERVICE_TYPE="customer retention"
export SERVICE_DESCRIPTION="solutions to keep your customers coming back"
export ADAPT_TO_CUSTOMER=true
```

### For WhatsApp Automation (Original)
```bash
export COMPANY_NAME="Main Outlet Media"
export SERVICE_TYPE="WhatsApp automation"
export SERVICE_DESCRIPTION="automated WhatsApp communication"
export ADAPT_TO_CUSTOMER=false
```

### For Dynamic Multi-Business
```bash
export ADAPT_TO_CUSTOMER=true  # Let system figure it out!
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the changes**
2. **Test with different customer types**
3. **Consider adding more business profiles**
4. **Monitor how well adaptation works**

## Quick Test

Run this to verify the fix works:
```bash
python3 test_adaptive_context.py
```

The system is now flexible and can adapt to different business contexts while maintaining its robust architecture!
