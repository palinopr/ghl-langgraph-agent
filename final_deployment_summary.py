print("‚úÖ FIXES THAT ARE WORKING:")
print("1. Agents ARE receiving extracted_data from intelligence layer")
print("2. Name extraction is working (jaime ‚Üí Jaime)")
print("3. Business extraction is working (restaurante extracted correctly)")
print("4. Agents are using extracted names (Mucho gusto, Jaime)")
print()

print("‚ùå ISSUES STILL PRESENT:")
print("1. Generic 'negocio' extraction triggers business question")
print("   - When extracted_data has business_type='negocio', agents still ask")
print("   - This might be intentional (negocio is too generic)")
print()
print("2. Conversation context confusion")
print("   - In trace 3, Maria says 'Mucho gusto, Jaime' but name wasn't in that message")
print("   - Suggests agents might be seeing full conversation history")
print()
print("3. Fuzzy matching not loaded")
print("   - No evidence of fuzzy extractor in logs")
print("   - Need to verify if rapidfuzz is installed in deployment")
print()

print("üîç RECOMMENDATIONS:")
print("1. Check if 'negocio' should be treated as 'no business extracted'")
print("2. Verify agents are checking current extracted_data, not just history")
print("3. Ensure rapidfuzz is installed in deployment environment")
print("4. Consider adding more debug logging to see enforcer decisions")
print()

print("üìä OVERALL STATUS:")
print("The core fix IS working - agents receive and use extracted_data.")
print("However, there are edge cases that need refinement:")
print("- Generic business terms ('negocio') handling")
print("- Conversation context management")
print("- Fuzzy matching activation")
print()

print("üöÄ NEXT STEPS:")
print("1. Test with typos like 'reaturante' to verify fuzzy matching")
print("2. Monitor for more conversation samples")
print("3. Check if 'negocio' extraction should be ignored")
print("4. Verify deployment has all dependencies installed")
