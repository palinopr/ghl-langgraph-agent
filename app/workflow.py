OPTIMIZED WORKFLOW - AI Supervisor with Context-Aware Agents
Flow: Webhook → Parallel Receptionist → Intelligence → AI Supervisor → Agent → Responder

Key Improvements:
1. Parallel data loading (3x faster)
2. AI Supervisor provides rich context to agents
3. Agents don't re-analyze conversations
4. Simplified state (15 fields instead of 50+)
5. Parallel tool execution available

This implements the OPTIMIZED flow pattern where:
- Receptionist loads data in parallel
- AI Supervisor analyzes and provides context
- Agents focus on responding, not analyzing
- Clear, efficient flow with no redundancy
