# Maria Agent Repeated Question Analysis - Trace 1f064e45

## Executive Summary

**ISSUE CONFIRMED**: Maria is still asking "Â¿QuÃ© tipo de negocio tienes?" even after the user already responded "Restaurante" twice. This indicates our previous fix did not resolve the duplicate question tracking issue.

## Trace Details

- **Trace ID**: 1f064e45-bb3d-6835-9e97-a6140d66431f
- **Timestamp**: 2025-07-19T21:07:20 - 21:07:24
- **Status**: Success (but with incorrect behavior)
- **Total Tokens**: 2152

## Conversation Flow Analysis

### Messages in Order:

1. **USER (new)**: "Restaurante"
2. **USER (ghl_history)**: "Restaurante" (21:07:16)
3. **AI (ghl_history)**: "Mucho gusto, Jaime. Â¿QuÃ© tipo de negocio tienes?" (21:07:07)
4. **USER (ghl_history)**: "Jaime" (21:06:56)
5. **AI (ghl_history)**: "Â¡Hola! ðŸ‘‹ Ayudo a las empresas a automatizar WhatsApp..." (21:06:47)
6. **USER (ghl_history)**: "Hola" (21:06:39)
7. **AI (receptionist)**: "DATA LOADED SUCCESSFULLY..."
8. **AI (supervisor_brain)**: "SUPERVISOR ANALYSIS COMPLETE... Business: NO_MENCIONADO"
9. **AI (maria)**: "Mucho gusto, Jaime. Â¿QuÃ© tipo de negocio tienes?"

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Supervisor Misclassification
The supervisor incorrectly classified the business as "NO_MENCIONADO" despite the user saying "Restaurante" twice:
- User input: "Restaurante" (both new and from history)
- Supervisor output: "Business: NO_MENCIONADO"

### 2. Maria Repeating Question
Maria asks the same question that was already asked in the conversation history:
- Historical AI message: "Â¿QuÃ© tipo de negocio tienes?" (21:07:07)
- User response: "Restaurante" (21:07:16)
- Maria's new response: "Â¿QuÃ© tipo de negocio tienes?" (duplicate)

### 3. Context Not Being Used
Maria receives the full conversation history including:
- The user saying "Restaurante" twice
- The previous AI asking about business type
- The user already answering with "Restaurante"

Yet she still asks the same question again.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Supervisor Brain Issue
The supervisor is not correctly parsing the user's business type from their message:
```
Input: "Restaurante"
Supervisor Analysis: "Business: NO_MENCIONADO"
```

This suggests the supervisor's business type detection logic is broken.

### 2. Maria's Context Processing
Even with full conversation history, Maria is not recognizing that:
- The business type question was already asked
- The user already provided the answer ("Restaurante")

### 3. Possible Code Issues
Based on the trace, potential problems include:
- Supervisor's business type extraction regex/logic not working
- Maria's prompt not instructing her to check previous questions
- The conversation state not tracking answered questions

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Supervisor Business Detection**
   - Check the supervisor_brain.py business type extraction logic
   - Ensure it can detect single-word business types like "Restaurante"

2. **Update Maria's Prompt**
   - Add explicit instructions to check if questions were already asked
   - Include logic to extract information from user's previous responses

3. **Add Conversation State Tracking**
   - Track which questions have been asked and answered
   - Pass this state to agents to prevent duplicates

4. **Add Unit Tests**
   - Test supervisor's business type detection with various inputs
   - Test Maria's ability to recognize answered questions

## Next Steps

1. Review supervisor_brain.py business detection logic
2. Review maria_agent_v2.py prompt and context handling
3. Add logging to track what each agent sees and decides
4. Implement proper question tracking in conversation state
