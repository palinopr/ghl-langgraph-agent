## Key Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. **Deterministic Intelligence**: Regex patterns more reliable than LLM extraction
2. **Linear Flow**: Preventing agent loops improved stability
3. **Stateless Design**: GHL as source of truth simplified architecture
4. **Incremental Refactoring**: Small, safe changes over big rewrites

### What Didn't Work
1. **Complex State**: 113 fields was overkill
2. **Agent-to-Agent Transfers**: Created expensive loops
3. **Over-Engineering**: Many features never used
4. **LLM Extraction**: Less accurate than regex for structured data

### Critical Fixes Applied
1. **Context Loading**: Every message loads full history
2. **Score Persistence**: Scores saved to GHL custom fields
3. **Message Batching**: 15-second window for human-like responses
4. **Language Consistency**: Spanish prompts prevent English responses
5. **Validation First**: Pre-deployment checks prevent failures

## Migration Notes

### From v1.x to v2.0
1. Update to Python 3.13
2. Use new MinimalState schema
3. Import from ghl_client_simple
4. Run `make validate` before deployment

### Breaking Changes in v2.0
- State schema completely changed
- Many workflow files removed
- Agent imports updated
- GHL client simplified

## Future Roadmap

### Planned Features
- Vector store for semantic search
- Voice message support
- Multi-language support
- Advanced analytics
- A/B testing framework

### Technical Debt
- Complete test coverage
- API documentation
- Performance benchmarks
- Security audit
