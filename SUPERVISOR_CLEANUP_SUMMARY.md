# Supervisor Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Fixed Critical Routing Bug
- Changed `route_from_supervisor` to `route_from_smart_router`
- Fixed check from `supervisor_complete` to `router_complete`
- This was causing routing failures!

### 2. ✅ Renamed All Functions and Tools
- `escalate_to_supervisor` → `escalate_to_router` in:
  - agent_tools.py
  - maria_agent.py
  - carlos_agent.py
  - sofia_agent.py
  - __init__ files

### 3. ✅ Updated State Fields
- `supervisor_complete` → `router_complete` in ProductionState

### 4. ✅ Cleaned Up References
- Updated responder to skip "smart_router" instead of "supervisor"
- Updated maria's prompt to exclude router messages
- Commented out supervisor imports in __init__.py
- Renamed supervisor.py to supervisor_obsolete.py.bak

### 5. ✅ Fixed Workflow Routing
- Updated conditional edges to use `route_from_smart_router`
- Verified `needs_escalation` works correctly for agent → router escalation

## Verification

The workflow now correctly flows:
1. thread_mapper → receptionist → smart_router
2. smart_router → agents (maria/carlos/sofia) based on score
3. agents → responder (or back to smart_router if escalating)
4. responder → END

## No More Supervisor!

The supervisor has been completely replaced by the smart_router throughout the codebase. All references have been updated and the system should work correctly without any supervisor-related errors.
