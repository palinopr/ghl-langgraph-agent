# Information Collection Fix Summary

## Problem
The system was jumping straight to demo closing without collecting all required information (name, business type, problem, budget).

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Conversation Analyzer (`app/utils/conversation_analyzer.py`)
- Added "budget" to the pending_info list
- Updated stage logic for all agents:
  - **Maria**: Requires name, business_type, and specific_problem before handoff
  - **Carlos**: Requires ALL info (name, business, problem, budget) before moving to demo
  - **Sofia**: Only works when all 4 fields are collected, otherwise returns "too_early_need_qualification"

### 2. Fixed Carlos Agent (`app/agents/carlos_agent.py`)
- Fixed bug: Changed `collected_data` to `extracted_data` on line 170
- Added stage-based strategy with clear steps:
  - DISCOVERY: Focus on missing info one at a time
  - QUALIFICATION: Gather remaining fields
  - VALUE BUILDING: Show ROI (only after all info collected)
  - READY FOR DEMO: Close the appointment

### 3. Updated Maria Agent (`app/agents/maria_agent.py`)
- Added step-by-step approach with current priority
- Clear questions for each missing field
- Proper stage progression

### 4. Enhanced Sofia Agent (`app/agents/sofia_agent.py`)
- Added stage check to prevent early demo booking
- Will escalate back to Carlos if basic info is missing
- Only asks for email when all qualification is complete

## Key Principles

1. **One Question at a Time**: Agents ask for one piece of information at a time
2. **Stage Progression**: 
   - Discovery → Qualification → Value Building → Demo Closing
3. **Required Fields**:
   - Name
   - Business Type
   - Specific Problem/Goal
   - Budget
   - Email (only for demo booking)

## Testing

Run the test to verify proper flow:
```bash
python3 test_proper_flow.py
```

The system now ensures all information is collected before attempting to book demos.
