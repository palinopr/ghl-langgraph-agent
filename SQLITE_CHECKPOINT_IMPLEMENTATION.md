# SQLite Persistent Checkpointer Implementation

## Problem Solved
MemorySaver was in-memory only, losing all conversation history between webhook calls. This caused every message to start fresh, making agents unable to understand context like "Si" responses.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Dependencies
```txt
aiosqlite>=0.19.0
langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite>=2.0.10
```

### 2. Replaced MemorySaver with AsyncSqliteSaver
```python
# BEFORE:
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
memory = MemorySaver()

# AFTER:
from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite.aio import AsyncSqliteSaver
checkpoint_db = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "checkpoints.db")
memory = AsyncSqliteSaver.from_conn_string(checkpoint_db)
```

### 3. Enhanced Checkpoint Debugging
```python
if checkpoint_tuple and checkpoint_tuple.checkpoint:
    existing_state = checkpoint_tuple.checkpoint.get("channel_values", {})
    existing_messages = existing_state.get("messages", [])
    logger.info(f"âœ… Loaded {len(existing_messages)} messages from SQLite for thread {thread_id}")
    if existing_messages:
        logger.info(f"Last message: '{existing_messages[-1].content}'")
else:
    logger.info(f"ðŸ†• No checkpoint in SQLite for thread {thread_id} - new conversation")
```

### 4. Consistent Thread ID
```python
thread_id = f"contact-{contact_id}"  # Always based on contact
logger.info(f"Thread ID: {thread_id} for contact: {contact_id}")
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **First Message**: Creates SQLite checkpoint in `checkpoints.db`
2. **"Si" Response**: Loads full conversation from SQLite
3. **Context Preserved**: Maria sees previous messages and responds appropriately
4. **Persistent Storage**: `checkpoints.db` file persists on disk between deployments

## Validation Logs

Look for these in production logs:
- `âœ… Loaded X messages from SQLite for thread contact-XXX`
- `ðŸ†• No checkpoint in SQLite for thread contact-XXX - new conversation`
- `Using SQLite checkpoint database: /path/to/checkpoints.db`

## Files Modified

1. `requirements.txt` - Added SQLite dependencies
2. `app/workflow.py` - Replaced MemorySaver with AsyncSqliteSaver
3. `.gitignore` - Already excludes `*.db` files

## Success Criteria

âœ… Physical `checkpoints.db` file exists
âœ… Conversation history persists between messages
âœ… No more repetitive greetings on "Si"
âœ… Agents understand context from previous messages
