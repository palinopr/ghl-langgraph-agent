# Conversation Tracking Summary

## ✅ All Conversational Agents Have Tracking

### Shared Conversation Analyzer (`app/utils/conversation_analyzer.py`)
Tracks:
- **Greeting Status**: Whether agent has greeted
- **Exchange Count**: Number of customer-agent exchanges
- **Topics Discussed**: What info has been collected (name, business, problem, budget, email)
- **Pending Info**: What still needs to be collected
- **Conversation Stage**: Where we are in the flow
- **Objections**: Any customer objections raised
- **Demo Attempts**: Number of demo booking attempts

### Maria Agent
- **Stages**: discovery → initial_qualification → ready_for_handoff
- **Focus**: Collects name, business type, and problem
- **Tracking Benefits**:
  - Never repeats greetings
  - Knows what info to ask for next
  - Hands off to Carlos when ready

### Carlos Agent

- **Focus**: Collects all info including budget before showing value
- **Tracking Benefits**:
  - Follows proper qualification flow

## Non-Conversational Agents (Don't Need Tracking)

### Smart Router
- Just analyzes and routes - no conversation

### Receptionist Agent  
- Loads conversation history - no prompts

### Responder Agent
- Sends messages - no conversation

### Thread ID Mapper
- Maps thread IDs - no conversation

## Usage Example

```python
# In any agent prompt function:
conversation_analysis = analyze_conversation_state(messages, agent_name="maria")

# Use the analysis to guide conversation:
if conversation_analysis['has_greeted']:
    # Don't greet again
if 'budget' in conversation_analysis['pending_info']:
    # Ask for budget
if conversation_analysis['stage'] == 'ready_for_handoff':
    # Escalate to next agent
```

All conversational agents now have intelligent conversation tracking to prevent repetition and ensure proper information collection!
