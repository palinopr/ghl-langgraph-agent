# Deployment Complete - July 21, 2025

## Deployment Summary

âœ… **Successfully deployed all fixes to production at 12:20 PM CDT**

### Fixes Deployed

1. **Supervisor Historical Context Boost**
   - Fixed score jumping from 2 to 6 for simple "hola"
   - Only boosts score when current message is business-related
   - Smart context detection prevents over-scoring

2. **Note Creation**
   - Fixed undefined variables in note creation
   - Notes now properly track all changes
   - Complete audit trail in GHL

### Key Changes

#### File: `app/agents/supervisor_brain_with_ai.py`
- Lines 285-300: Smart context-aware score boosting
- Lines 418-453: Proper note creation with variable tracking

### Expected Behavior

| Message | Before | After |
|---------|--------|--------|
| "hola" (returning customer) | Score 6 | Score 2-3 |
| "necesito ayuda con mi restaurante" | Score 6 | Score 4-6 |
| "estoy perdiendo clientes" | Score 6 | Score 6+ |

### Verification

Monitor the next few traces to confirm:
1. Simple greetings stay at low scores (2-3)
2. Business context messages get appropriate boosts
3. Notes are created with each analysis
4. No more 14 historical messages loading

### Next Steps

1. Monitor production traces for the next hour
2. Verify score distribution is more reasonable
3. Check that notes are being created in GHL
4. Consider the performance optimization task if needed
