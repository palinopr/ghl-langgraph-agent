# Fix All Remaining Issues - Complete Solution

## Issues to Fix:
1. Fuzzy matching not loading in production
2. Generic 'negocio' still being extracted in some cases
3. Conversation context confusion

## Fix 1: Fuzzy Matching Import Issue

The fuzzy extractor is failing to import. We need to make it more robust:

```python
# In analyzer.py, improve the import handling:
try:
    from app.intelligence.fuzzy_extractor import FuzzyBusinessExtractor
    FUZZY_ENABLED = True
    logger.info("Fuzzy extractor loaded successfully")
except ImportError as e:
    FUZZY_ENABLED = False
    FuzzyBusinessExtractor = None  # Define as None for safety
    logger.warning(f"Fuzzy extractor not available: {str(e)}")
except Exception as e:
    FUZZY_ENABLED = False
    FuzzyBusinessExtractor = None
    logger.error(f"Failed to load fuzzy extractor: {str(e)}")
```

## Fix 2: Generic Business Term Handling

The analyzer already validates and rejects "negocio", but we need to ensure:
1. Pattern extraction doesn't capture it in the first place
2. All agents handle None business_type correctly

## Fix 3: Conversation Context

The issue is that agents are using conversation history through the conversation enforcer. We need to ensure agents prioritize current extracted_data over historical context.

## Implementation Plan:

### Step 1: Fix Fuzzy Import
- Add better error handling
- Create dummy class if import fails
- Ensure deployment has rapidfuzz installed

### Step 2: Fix Business Extraction
- Update regex patterns to exclude generic terms
- Ensure validation is bulletproof
- Update agent prompts to handle None business correctly

### Step 3: Fix Context Usage
- Update agent prompts to clarify current vs historical data
- Ensure extracted_data takes precedence
- Add clear comments in code
