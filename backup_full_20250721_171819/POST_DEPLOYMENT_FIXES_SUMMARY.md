## Issues Fixed

### 1. Fuzzy Matching Not Loading in Production ✅

**Problem**: The fuzzy extractor module wasn't loading in production, causing typo tolerance to fail.

**Root Cause**: Import errors were not properly handled, causing silent failures.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added proper exception handling in `app/intelligence/analyzer.py`:
  - Added specific `ImportError` handling with error message logging
  - Added general `Exception` handling for unexpected errors
  - Enhanced error messages to show the actual error

- Added fallback mechanism in `app/intelligence/fuzzy_extractor.py`:
  - Added try-except around `rapidfuzz` import
  - Created dummy objects when RapidFuzz is not available
  - Added availability check in methods to prevent errors
  - Added warning logs when RapidFuzz is not available

### 2. Generic 'negocio' Extraction Issue ✅

**Problem**: When `business_type='negocio'`, agents still asked for specific business type because "negocio" (business) is too generic.

**Root Cause**: The system was treating generic terms like "negocio", "empresa", "local" as valid business types.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `app/intelligence/analyzer.py`:
  - Added generic terms list: `["negocio", "business", "empresa", "comercio", "local"]`
  - Modified `_validate_business_type()` to reject generic terms
  - Updated regex patterns to exclude generic terms
  - Only accept SPECIFIC business types like "restaurante", "barbería", etc.

- Updated `app/intelligence/fuzzy_extractor.py`:
  - Removed "negocio" from the business types dictionary
  - Added comment explaining why it was removed

- Updated `app/utils/conversation_formatter.py`:
  - Added checks to exclude generic business terms when determining if business is collected
  - Updated all business type checks to filter out generic terms

- Updated `app/utils/conversation_analyzer.py`:
  - Added validation to reject generic business terms when collecting business type
  - Keeps expecting a specific business type if generic term is provided

### 3. Conversation Context Confusion ✅

**Problem**: Agents were using old conversation data incorrectly, especially for names.

**Root Cause**: The system correctly extracts data from current state, but the documentation wasn't clear about this behavior.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced documentation in `app/intelligence/analyzer.py`:
  - Added CRITICAL comments explaining that extraction is from CURRENT message only
  - Clarified that previous_data is merged to maintain state
  - Emphasized that this prevents agents from using old conversation history incorrectly

- The system was already working correctly:
  - `extract_all()` method extracts from current message only
  - Previous data is preserved through merging
  - Agents use `extracted_data` from state, which is the current accumulated data
  - Conversation formatter uses current `extracted_data`, not message history

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: Production will now show clear error messages if dependencies fail to load
2. **Stricter Business Validation**: Generic terms are no longer accepted as valid business types
3. **Clearer Documentation**: Critical behavior is now well-documented to prevent confusion

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with messages containing "tengo un negocio" - should ask for specific business type
2. Test with typos like "reaturante" - should work if RapidFuzz is available, fall back to exact matching if not
3. Verify agents use current extracted_data, not old conversation history
4. Check production logs for any import errors related to fuzzy matching
