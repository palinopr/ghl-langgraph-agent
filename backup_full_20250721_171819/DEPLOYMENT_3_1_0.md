# Deployment 3.1.0 - Modernized Architecture

## üöÄ Deployment Status: COMPLETE

**Date:** July 21, 2025  
**Version:** 3.1.0  
**Branch:** main  
**Commits:** 
- `61b48e3` - Modernize LangGraph architecture with official patterns
- `b42380f` - Bump version to 3.1.0 for modernized architecture deployment

## üìã What's New

### Critical Improvements
1. **Health Check Endpoints**
   - `/health` - Service health with version info
   - `/metrics` - Performance metrics and monitoring
   - `/ok` - Simple health check (LangGraph standard)

2. **Official Supervisor Pattern**
   - Implemented using `create_react_agent`
   - Handoff tools with task descriptions
   - Command objects for all routing

3. **Enhanced Command Pattern**
   - All tools return Command objects
   - Task context preserved in handoffs
   - Clear escalation paths

### Medium Improvements
1. **Simplified State Schema**
   - Reduced from 50+ to 15 fields
   - Extends MessagesState base class
   - Helper functions for common operations

2. **Evaluation Framework**
   - 10+ comprehensive test cases
   - Automated testing suite
   - Performance comparison tools

## üîç Verification Steps

1. **Check Deployment Status** (wait 2-5 minutes):
   ```bash
   curl https://YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-URL.us.langgraph.app/health
   ```

2. **Test New Endpoints**:
   ```bash
   # Health check
   curl https://YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-URL.us.langgraph.app/health
   
   # Metrics
   curl https://YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-URL.us.langgraph.app/metrics
   
   # Simple check
   curl https://YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-URL.us.langgraph.app/ok
   ```

3. **Run Local Evaluation**:
   ```bash
   python test_evaluation.py
   ```

## üìÅ New Files Deployed

- `app/agents/supervisor_official.py` - Official supervisor implementation
- `app/agents/maria_modernized.py` - Modernized Maria agent
- `app/tools/agent_tools_modernized.py` - Enhanced Command pattern tools
- `app/state/simplified_state.py` - Simplified state schema
- `app/workflow_modernized.py` - Modernized workflow
- `app/workflow_simplified.py` - Simplified state workflow
- `app/evaluation/eval_framework.py` - Evaluation framework
- `test_evaluation.py` - Test runner

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Current Workflow**: The deployment still uses the memory-optimized workflow. To switch to the modernized version:
   - Update `app/workflow.py` to import `modernized_workflow`
   - Test thoroughly before deploying

2. **Backward Compatibility**: All new components are backward compatible with existing state and tools

3. **Monitoring**: Use the new `/metrics` endpoint to monitor performance after deployment

## üìä Expected Improvements

- **Performance**: Reduced state overhead should improve response times
- **Reliability**: Official patterns reduce edge cases
- **Maintainability**: Simplified state and clear patterns
- **Observability**: Health endpoints provide better monitoring

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. Monitor deployment logs for any issues
2. Test health endpoints once deployed
3. Consider switching to modernized workflow after testing
4. Set up monitoring dashboards using metrics endpoint

## üìû Support

If issues arise:
1. Check deployment logs in LangSmith
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Run local evaluation to compare behavior
4. Roll back to 3.0.7 if needed
