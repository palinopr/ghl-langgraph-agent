# Maria Agent Bug Fix Summary

## Problem Description
Maria was repeating the business type question even after the user already answered it.

### Example Conversation (Buggy Behavior):
1. User: "Hola"
2. Maria: "¡Hola! 👋 Ayudo... ¿Cuál es tu nombre?"
3. User: "Jaime"
4. Maria: "Mucho gusto, Jaime. ¿Qué tipo de negocio tienes?"
5. User: "Restaurante"
6. Maria: "Mucho gusto, Jaime. ¿Qué tipo de negocio tienes?" ❌ (REPEATING!)

### Expected Behavior:
6. Maria: "Ya veo, restaurante. ¿Cuál es tu mayor desafío con los mensajes de WhatsApp?" ✅

## Root Cause Analysis

Maria had **TWO conversation analysis systems** running in parallel:

1. **conversation_enforcer** (lines 42-48) - ✅ CORRECT
   - Properly tracks conversation state
   - Correctly identifies answers
   - Provides the right next action

2. **Redundant logic** (lines 60-86) - ❌ BUGGY
   - Re-analyzed the entire conversation
   - Overwrote the correct analysis
   - Caused state confusion

The redundant logic was analyzing historical messages but failing to recognize that the current message ("Restaurante") was the answer to the business question.

## The Fix

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed redundant conversation analysis** (deleted lines 60-86 in maria_agent_v2.py)
   - Eliminated the conflicting analysis logic
   - Now relies solely on conversation_enforcer

2. **Updated context building** (lines 61-87)
   - Uses only conversation_enforcer data
   - Shows current stage, next action, and collected data
   - Displays the allowed response clearly

3. **Applied same fix to Sofia agent** (sofia_agent_v2.py)
   - Removed similar redundant logic
   - Ensures consistency across agents

### Key Code Changes:

```python
# BEFORE (Buggy):
# Initialize additional flags (will be updated in analysis)
asked_for_name = False
asked_for_business = False
asked_for_problem = False

# Analyze conversation flow
for i, msg in enumerate(messages):
    # ... 20+ lines of redundant analysis ...

# AFTER (Fixed):
# Extract data from conversation analysis
customer_name = collected_data['name']
business_type = collected_data['business']
```

## Impact

The fix ensures:
- ✅ No repeated questions
- ✅ Correct conversation flow
- ✅ Proper state tracking
- ✅ Single source of truth (conversation_enforcer)

## Testing

The conversation_enforcer correctly:
1. Identifies "Restaurante" as the business answer
2. Sets `collected_data['business'] = 'restaurante'`
3. Moves to the next stage (asking about problems)
4. Provides the correct allowed response

## Files Modified

1. `/app/agents/maria_agent_v2.py` - Removed redundant analysis, updated context building
2. `/app/agents/sofia_agent_v2.py` - Applied same fix for consistency

## Verification

The fix eliminates the duplicate conversation tracking that was causing Maria to lose track of the conversation state. Now there's a single, reliable source of truth for conversation flow management.
