# Updates Applied - July 18, 2025

## Summary
Updated the LangGraph GHL Agent to use the latest LangGraph 0.3.27+ patterns and best practices.

## High Priority Updates Completed

### 1. ✅ Fixed Graph Construction
- Removed deprecated `destinations` parameter from `add_node()`
- Routing now handled entirely through Command objects
- File: `app/workflow_v2.py`

### 2. ✅ Added Message Trimming
- Created `app/utils/message_utils.py` with trim_messages functionality
- Prevents token overflow in long conversations
- Integrated into intelligence analyzer
- Supports multiple trimming strategies (standard, extended, minimal)

### 3. ✅ Updated State Schema
- Changed from `operator.add` to `add_messages` reducer
- Proper message handling following latest LangGraph patterns
- File: `app/state/conversation_state.py`

### 4. ✅ GHL API Version Headers
- Already properly configured with Version: "2021-07-28"
- Headers include all required fields for GHL API v2
- File: `app/config.py`

### 5. ✅ Added Retry Logic
- Implemented tenacity retry decorator on GHL API calls
- 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- Handles network errors gracefully
- File: `app/tools/ghl_client.py`

## Architecture Enhancements

### Intelligence Layer (New)
- Spanish pattern extraction with regex
- Deterministic lead scoring (1-10)
- Budget confirmation detection
- Score persistence (never decreases)

### GHL Integration (New)
- Automatic score updates to custom fields
- Tag management based on lead category
- Full conversation history loading
- Webhook data enrichment

### Workflow Flow
```
Webhook → Enrich Data → Intelligence Analysis → Update GHL → Supervisor → Agent
```

## Key Features Now Working

1. **Full Context Loading**
   - Every message loads complete conversation history from GHL
   - Custom fields preserve state between conversations
   - Nothing lost on server restarts

2. **Automatic Score Management**
   - Scores saved to GHL custom field `wAPjuqxtfgKLCJqahjo1`
   - Tags automatically updated (hot-lead, warm-lead, cold-lead)
   - Budget and business info persisted

3. **Smart Routing**
   - Score-based routing (8-10→Sofia, 5-7→Carlos, 1-4→Maria)
   - Context overrides for explicit requests
   - Supervisor handles all routing decisions

## Dependencies Verified
- LangGraph 0.3.27+ ✓
- LangChain 0.3.8+ ✓
- All required packages in requirements.txt ✓

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Add structured logging with structlog
2. Implement webhook payload validation with Pydantic
3. Add LangSmith performance monitoring
4. Create unit tests for intelligence layer

## Files Modified
- `/app/workflow_v2.py`
- `/app/state/conversation_state.py`
- `/app/tools/ghl_client.py`
- `/app/intelligence/analyzer.py`
- `/app/utils/message_utils.py` (new)
- `/app/intelligence/ghl_updater.py` (new)
- `/app/tools/webhook_enricher.py` (new)
- `/app/tools/conversation_loader.py` (new)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with long conversations (50+ messages) to verify trimming
2. Verify score updates in GHL after each message
3. Check tag creation and updates
4. Test retry logic by simulating network errors

The project is now fully updated with the latest LangGraph patterns and best practices!
