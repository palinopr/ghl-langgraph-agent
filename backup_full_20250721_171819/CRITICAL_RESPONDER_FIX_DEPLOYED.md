# CRITICAL: Responder Fix Deployed

## Problem Found
The responder was not finding any agent messages to send because:
1. The "fixed" agents (maria_agent_v2_fixed, carlos_agent_v2_fixed, sofia_agent_v2_fixed) don't set a 'name' attribute on their AIMessages
2. The responder was looking for messages with name='maria'/'carlos'/'sofia' 
3. Since no messages had these names, ALL agent responses were being skipped

## Root Cause
- LangGraph's `create_react_agent` doesn't automatically add the agent name to messages
- The fixed agents return messages without name attributes
- The responder's filtering logic was too strict, requiring explicit names

## Solution Implemented
1. **Primary Fix**: Check `state['current_agent']` to know which agent just responded
2. **Smart Selection**: If current_agent is maria/carlos/sofia, select the last AIMessage regardless of name
3. **Fallback Logic**: Still check for named messages as a fallback
4. **Debug Logging**: Added extensive logging to diagnose message selection
5. **Better Error Handling**: Errors are now logged instead of silently ignored

## Code Changes
**File**: `app/agents/responder_streaming.py`
- Added current_agent detection from state
- If current_agent matches an agent name, trust the last AIMessage
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Improved error handling with fallback attempts

## Deployment
- **Commit**: 7179eec
- **Deployed**: July 21, 2025, 4:36 PM CDT
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully deployed

## Expected Impact
- Customers will now receive responses from agents
- The system will properly identify and send agent messages
- Better visibility into what messages are being selected/skipped

## Monitoring
Check production logs for:
- "✅ Found AI message from current agent"
- "✅ Fallback send successful" (if primary send fails)
- Any "❌" messages indicating failures

## Next Steps
1. Monitor production traces to confirm messages are being sent
2. Check that customers are receiving responses
3. Verify no duplicate messages are being sent
4. Consider cleaning up the many duplicate agent files in the codebase
