# Post-Deployment Verification Plan

## Deployment Info
- **Pushed at**: July 21, 2025, 12:20 PM CDT (17:20 UTC)
- **Expected Live**: ~12:35 PM CDT (15 minutes for build/deploy)
- **Commit**: 3f86593

## What We Fixed
1. **Supervisor Historical Boost**: No more score 6 for simple "hola"
2. **Note Creation**: Fixed undefined variables
3. **Smart Context Detection**: Only boosts when current message is business-related

## How to Verify Deployment is Live

### 1. Check LangSmith Deployment Status
```bash
# Look for "Last Updated" timestamp in LangSmith UI
# Should show a time after 12:20 PM CDT
```

### 2. Send Test Messages via GHL
Send these messages to test each scenario:

#### Test 1: Simple Greeting (Most Important!)
```
Message: "hola"
Expected: 
- Score: 2-3 (NOT 6!)
- Route: Maria
- No score boost from history
```

#### Test 2: Business Context
```
Message: "necesito ayuda con mi restaurante"
Expected:
- Score: 4-6
- Route: Carlos
- Modest boost if returning customer
```

#### Test 3: Time Selection (Not Budget)
```
Message: "10:00 AM"
Expected:
- No budget extraction
- Score unchanged
```

### 3. Run SDK Verification
```bash
# After sending test messages, run:
python test_deployment_with_sdk.py

# This will analyze the new traces and verify:
- Scores are appropriate
- No debug messages
- Supervisor not over-boosting
```

### 4. Check Specific Issues

#### A. Historical Context Boost
```python
# The problematic trace before deployment:
# Input: "hola" → Intelligence: 2 → Supervisor: 6 ❌

# After deployment should be:
# Input: "hola" → Intelligence: 2 → Supervisor: 2-3 ✅
```

#### B. Note Creation
- Check GHL contact notes
- Should see "Lead Analysis" notes with proper formatting
- No missing variable errors

## Quick Verification Script
```bash
# Run this after deployment is live:
./check_recent_traces.py

# Look for:
1. Traces with timestamp > 17:20 UTC
2. "hola" messages with score 2-3
3. No supervisor boost to 6
```

## If Issues Persist

1. **Check deployment logs** in LangSmith
2. **Verify commit** 3f86593 is deployed
3. **Check for build errors**
4. **Test with fresh contact** (no history)

## Success Criteria
✅ "hola" → Score 2-3 (not 6)
✅ Business messages → Appropriate scores
✅ Notes created in GHL
✅ No debug messages in responses
✅ Supervisor only boosts when current message is business-related
