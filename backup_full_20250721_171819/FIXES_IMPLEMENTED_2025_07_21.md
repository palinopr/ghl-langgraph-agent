# Fixes Implemented - July 21, 2025

## Summary of All Fixes Applied

**Problem**: Loading 14+ historical messages from different conversations
**Solution**: Added thread filtering to only load current conversation
**File**: `app/tools/ghl_client.py`

### 2. ✅ Intelligence Extraction (Fixed) 
**Problem**: Extracting garbage data from entire conversation history
**Solution**: Extract only from current message, preserve previous data
**File**: `app/intelligence/analyzer.py`

### 3. ✅ Debug Message Filtering (Fixed)
**Problem**: Debug messages visible to customers
**Solution**: Enhanced filtering patterns in responder
**File**: `app/agents/responder_agent.py`

### 4. ✅ Sofia Problem Acknowledgment (Fixed)
**Problem**: Sofia jumping to email request when customer mentions problems
**Solution**: Added problem detection and acknowledgment logic
**File**: `app/agents/sofia_agent_v2.py`

### 5. ✅ Lead Scoring (Fixed)
**Problem**: Score 9/10 for simple "hola"
**Solution**: Conservative scoring algorithm, proper 1-10 scale
**Files**: `app/intelligence/analyzer.py`, `app/agents/supervisor_brain.py`

### 6. ✅ Data Validation (Fixed)
**Problem**: Extracting "negocio hola" as business type
**Solution**: Added validation methods and confidence thresholds
**File**: `app/intelligence/analyzer.py`

### 7. ✅ Confidence Thresholds (Fixed)
**Problem**: Low confidence extractions being used
**Solution**: Only use extractions with >0.7 confidence
**File**: `app/intelligence/analyzer.py`

### 8. ✅ Note Creation (Fixed)
**Problem**: Notes not being created in GHL
**Solution**: Added note creation with proper variables
**File**: `app/agents/supervisor_brain_with_ai.py`

### 9. ✅ Supervisor Historical Boost (Fixed)

**Solution**: Only boost score if current message is business-related
**File**: `app/agents/supervisor_brain_with_ai.py`

## Latest Fix Details

### Supervisor Historical Context Boost

**Before**: Any returning customer with business/problem in history got score 6
```python
if historical_business and historical_problem:
    previous_score = max(previous_score, 6)
```

**After**: Smart context-aware boosting
```python
# Check if current message is business-related
is_business_related = any(indicator in current_msg_lower for indicator in [
    "negocio", "restaurante", "ayuda", "necesito", "problema", 
    "reserva", "cliente", "perdiendo", "automatizar", "sistema",
    "cita", "agendar", "horario", "disponible", "consulta"
])

if historical_business and historical_problem and is_business_related:
    # Modest boost for business context
    previous_score = min(previous_score + 2, 6)
elif historical_business and historical_problem:
    # Small recognition boost
    previous_score = min(previous_score + 1, previous_score + 1)
```

## Expected Behavior After All Fixes

1. **"hola"** → Score 2-3 (not 9!)
2. **No debug messages** in customer responses
3. **Only current thread messages** loaded
4. **Proper data extraction** (no "negocio hola")
5. **Notes created** with each analysis
6. **Smart score boosting** based on context

## Testing the Fixes

```bash
# Test with simple greeting
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/message \
  -d '{"message": "hola", "contactId": "test123"}'
# Expected: Score 2-3, Carlos responds

# Test with business context
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/message \
  -d '{"message": "necesito ayuda con mi restaurante", "contactId": "test123"}'
# Expected: Score 4-6, Carlos qualifies

# Test with urgent problem
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/message \
  -d '{"message": "estoy perdiendo clientes", "contactId": "test123"}'
# Expected: Score 6+, Sofia offers help
```
