# Deployment Status Report

## 🔴 GitHub Actions Status: FAILED

Based on the monitoring output, the recent deployment attempts have failed:

```
completed	failure	fix: Add setup.py and fix LangGraph 0.5.3 agent architecture	Deploy LangGraph Agent	main	push
completed	failure	fix: Add setup.py and fix LangGraph 0.5.3 agent architecture	CI	main	push
```

## 📋 Next Steps to Fix Deployment:

### 1. Check GitHub Actions Logs
Visit: https://github.com/palinopr/ghl-langgraph-agent/actions

Look for the most recent failed workflow and check:
- Build errors
- Missing dependencies
- Environment variable issues

### 2. Common Deployment Issues:

#### a) Missing Dependencies
The error might be related to missing packages. Check if all dependencies in the new imports are in requirements.txt:
- `langgraph.types.Command`
- `langgraph.prebuilt.InjectedState`

#### b) Import Errors
The supervisor.py changes might have import issues. Verify:
- All imports are correct
- No circular dependencies

#### c) Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in GitHub Secrets:
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- LANGCHAIN_API_KEY
- Any GHL-related keys

### 3. Quick Fixes to Try:

#### Fix 1: Update imports in supervisor.py
The Command import might need to come from a different location in older LangGraph versions.

#### Fix 2: Check LangGraph version compatibility
Ensure requirements.txt has: `langgraph>=0.5.3`

#### Fix 3: Simplify the supervisor temporarily
If Command objects are causing issues, we might need to use a different approach.

## 📌 Action Items:

1. **Check the exact error** in GitHub Actions logs
2. **Report back** with the specific error message
3. **We'll create a hotfix** based on the error

## 🔍 To Get Error Details:

1. Go to: https://github.com/palinopr/ghl-langgraph-agent/actions
2. Click on the failed "Deploy LangGraph Agent" workflow
3. Look for the error in the build logs
4. Copy the error message

Once we have the specific error, we can create a targeted fix and redeploy.
