This folder contains analysis scripts, debug tools, and trace files that were used during development and debugging but are not needed for production deployment.

## What Was Moved

## Why These Were Moved

These files were essential during development for:
1. Debugging production issues
2. Analyzing trace data
3. Testing fixes locally
4. Documenting problems and solutions

However, they are not needed for the production deployment and were cluttering the main directory.

## Important Files Still in Main Directory

The following essential files remain:
- `app.py` - Main application
- `Makefile` - Build commands
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `langgraph.json` - Deployment config
- `.env` - Environment variables
- Core documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.)
- The `app/` folder with all source code

## Recovery

If you need any of these files back, they are safely stored here and can be moved back with:
```bash
mv backup_analysis_scripts_20250721/filename.py .
```
