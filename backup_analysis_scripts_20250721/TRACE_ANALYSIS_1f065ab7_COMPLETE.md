# Trace Analysis: 1f065ab7-af0c-6b8f-b629-457ad5e5145c

## Summary
This trace shows a conversation with Jaime Ortiz where he says "Estoy perdiendo restaurantes" (I'm losing restaurants). The system routed him to Maria instead of recognizing this as a business owner needing help.

## Key Issues Found

### 1. ❌ Wrong Agent Routing
- **Customer**: Jaime Ortiz (existing contact)
- **Message**: "Estoy perdiendo restaurantes" 
- **Previous info**: Already mentioned "Tengo u. Restaurante" in conversation history
- **Expected**: Should route to Carlos or Sofia (business owner with problem)
- **Actual**: Routed to Maria with generic greeting

### 2. ❌ Information Not Extracted
- **Business Type**: "restaurante" not extracted despite being in message
- **Problem**: "perdiendo" (losing) indicates urgency/problem
- **Previous Score**: 1/10 (too low for a business owner)
- **Expected Score**: Should be 6+ (has business + problem)

### 3. ❌ Context Ignored
Looking at conversation history:
1. Customer said: "Tengo u. Restaurante y estoy perdiendo muchas reservas pq no puedo contestar todo"
2. System responded with generic greeting
3. Now says: "Estoy perdiendo restaurantes"
4. System still gives generic greeting

The system is not maintaining context or extracting business information.

## Root Causes

### 1. Supervisor Not Extracting Business Info
The supervisor should extract "restaurante" from:
- Current message: "Estoy perdiendo restaurantes"
- Previous message: "Tengo u. Restaurante"

### 2. Score Not Updating
- Previous score: 1/10
- Should be: 6+ (has name + business + problem)
- The scoring logic isn't recognizing business mentions

### 3. Wrong Routing Decision
- Score 1 → Maria (correct for score, wrong for context)
- Should override based on business owner status

## Solution

### Fix 1: Enhance Business Extraction in supervisor_brain_simple.py
The pattern "perdiendo restaurantes" should be recognized as:
- Business type: restaurante
- Urgency: high (perdiendo = losing)
- Intent: needs help with business

### Fix 2: Update Scoring Logic
When customer mentions:
- Business type → +3 points
- Problem/urgency → +2 points
- "Perdiendo" (losing) → urgent flag

### Fix 3: Context-Aware Routing
Even with low score, if customer has:
- Business type mentioned
- Urgency/problem expressed
→ Route to Carlos (qualification) or Sofia (if ready to buy)

## Expected Behavior

For "Estoy perdiendo restaurantes":
1. **Extract**: business_type = "restaurante", urgency = "alta"
2. **Score**: Update to 6+ (name + business + problem)
3. **Route**: To Carlos for qualification
4. **Response**: "Entiendo que tienes un restaurante y estás perdiendo clientes. ¿Cuántas reservas pierdes aproximadamente?"

## Test Case
```python
# This should extract business info
message = "Estoy perdiendo restaurantes"
result = extract_info(message)
assert result["business_type"] == "restaurante"
assert result["urgency"] == "alta"
assert calculate_score(result) >= 6
```

## Action Items
1. Update Spanish pattern extraction to handle "perdiendo X" pattern
2. Fix scoring to recognize business owners
3. Add urgency detection for words like "perdiendo", "problema", "ayuda"
4. Ensure conversation history is considered in scoring
