## What to Look For

### 1. Input Analysis
- **Contact ID**: Check if it's a real GHL contact or test ID
- **Message Content**: What did the customer say?
- **Webhook Data**: Is this from GHL webhook or direct API?
- **Existing State**: What custom fields were loaded?

### 2. Workflow Execution
Check the node execution order:
1. **Receptionist** - Did it load contact data correctly?
2. **Supervisor Brain** - What score was calculated?
3. **Agent Selection** - Which agent (Maria/Carlos/Sofia) was chosen?
4. **Agent Response** - What did the agent decide?
5. **Responder** - Was the message sent successfully?

### 3. Common Issues to Check

#### State Persistence Issues
- Is the lead score maintaining between messages?
- Are custom fields being updated in GHL?
- Is conversation history loaded correctly?

#### Routing Issues
- Score 1-4 â†’ Maria
- Score 5-7 â†’ Carlos  
- Score 8+ â†’ Sofia
- Is the routing correct based on score?

#### Calendar/Appointment Issues
- If customer asked for "horarios disponibles" â†’ Did Sofia use calendar tool?
- If customer selected time (e.g., "martes 2pm") â†’ Did booking tool get called?
- Check for the log entries:
  - "ðŸ“… CHECK_CALENDAR_SIMPLE called"
  - "ðŸ“… BOOK_APPOINTMENT_SIMPLE called"

#### Response Issues
- Did the responder send a message?
- Any GHL API errors (400, 404)?
- Message formatting correct?

### 4. Error Patterns

#### "Contact not found"
```json
{"error":"Contact with id XXX not found"}
```
This means the contact ID doesn't exist in GHL.

#### "Recursion limit"
```
GraphRecursionError: Recursion limit of 25 reached
```
Agent is stuck in a loop, likely with tool usage.

#### Missing State
```
KeyError: 'contact_id'
```
State is not being passed correctly between nodes.

### 5. Expected Flow for Appointment Booking

1. Customer: "Quiero agendar una cita"
2. Receptionist: Loads contact data
3. Supervisor: Calculates score (should be 8+ for appointment intent)
4. Routes to Sofia
5. Sofia: Uses `check_calendar_simple` tool
6. Sofia: Returns available times
7. Customer: "Martes 2pm estÃ¡ bien"
8. Sofia: Uses `book_appointment_simple` tool
9. Sofia: Confirms appointment
10. Responder: Sends confirmation

### 6. Debug Information to Extract

From the trace, note:
- Total execution time
- Number of LLM calls
- Token usage
- Any retries or errors
- Final output/response

### 7. Quick Fixes Based on Common Issues

#### If Sofia isn't using tools:
- Check if prompt includes "USE_CALENDAR_TOOL" instruction
- Verify tools are in the agent's tool list
- Check for conversation enforcer interference

#### If score isn't persisting:
- Check supervisor_brain_simple.py is reading previous state
- Verify GHL custom field updates are working
- Check field mappings are correct

#### If wrong agent is selected:
- Verify score calculation in supervisor
- Check routing logic in workflow_linear.py
- Ensure score is being passed correctly
