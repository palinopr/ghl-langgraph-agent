# Why Production Differs from Local Tests ü§î

## The Core Issues in Production

### 1. **Sofia Speaking English** 
**Local Test**: ‚úÖ Works (we control the flow)
**Production**: ‚ùå Sofia responds in English

**WHY?** The deployed code has Sofia's prompt with English examples:
```python
- "Great! I need your email to send the calendar invite."
```

Sofia is literally copying these English examples instead of translating to Spanish.

### 2. **Maria Repeating Questions**
**Local Test**: ‚úÖ Progresses normally
**Production**: ‚ùå "¬øQu√© tipo de negocio tienes?" repeated 5 times

**WHY?** Two possible causes:
1. **State persistence issue** - The extracted business type isn't being saved/retrieved properly between messages
2. **Intelligence extraction failing** - Not detecting "restaurante" from customer messages

### 3. **Score Not Progressing Properly**
**Local Test**: ‚úÖ Score goes 1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4‚Üí5...
**Production**: ‚ùå Stuck at low scores, causing Maria to repeat

**WHY?** The supervisor isn't updating the score in GHL custom fields, or the extraction isn't working.

## Key Differences: Local vs Production

### 1. **Environment Variables**
- Local: Using your `.env` file
- Production: Different env vars that might affect behavior

### 2. **Code Version**
- Local: Latest code with all fixes
- Production: May have older code or missing files

### 3. **RapidFuzz Library**
- Local: Shows warning "RapidFuzz not available"
- Production: Might be failing entirely without fuzzy matching

### 4. **Message Flow**
- Local: We send one message at a time with delays
- Production: Real customers send messages rapidly

## The Real Problem

**The deployed code doesn't match what we're testing locally!**

Evidence:
1. Sofia has English in her prompt (needs Spanish)
2. Maria isn't checking extracted_data properly
3. The intelligence layer might not be extracting business types

## Quick Fixes Needed

### 1. Fix Sofia's Language (Immediate)
```python
# In sofia_agent_v2_fixed.py, add at the top:
IMPORTANTE: Responde SIEMPRE en espa√±ol. NUNCA en ingl√©s.

# Replace English examples with Spanish:
"¬°Perfecto! Necesito tu email para enviarte la invitaci√≥n."
```

### 2. Fix Maria's Repetition
```python
# In maria_agent_v2.py, ensure she checks:
if extracted_data.get('business_type'):
    # Don't ask for business again!
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
The code in production might be different from local. Need to:
1. Check what version is deployed
2. Ensure all fixes are included
3. Verify environment variables

## Why Tests Pass But Production Fails

**Tests pass because we're testing the FIXED code locally.**
**Production fails because it's running OLDER/DIFFERENT code.**

This is a classic deployment synchronization issue!

## Action Items
1. Check exact code version deployed
2. Ensure Sofia's prompt is Spanish-only
3. Verify Maria checks extracted_data
4. Confirm all environment variables
5. Deploy the actual fixes we've been testing
