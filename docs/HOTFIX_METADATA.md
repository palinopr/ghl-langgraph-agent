## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PRODUCTION HOTFIX

### Issue
**Error**: `Pregel.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'metadata'`
**Impact**: Production deployment broken
**Root Cause**: LangGraph version mismatch - deployed environment doesn't support metadata parameter

### What Was Broken
In `app/workflow.py`, after compiling the workflow, we were trying to add metadata:
```python
# This was breaking production:
compiled.metadata = {
    "version": "3.0.8",
    "pattern": "official_supervisor",
    "features": [...]
}
```

### What Was Changed
1. **Removed metadata assignment** from workflow.py (lines 193-199)
   - Deleted the entire `compiled.metadata = {...}` block
   - Workflow now returns immediately after compilation

### Why It Broke
- Local development environment may have a newer LangGraph version that supports metadata
- Production deployment environment has a version that doesn't support this parameter
- The `metadata` attribute was added in a newer version of LangGraph/Pregel

### Fix Applied
```python
# BEFORE:
logger.info("Modernized workflow compiled successfully")

# Add metadata for health checks
compiled.metadata = {
    "version": "3.0.8",
    ...
}

return compiled

# AFTER:
logger.info("Modernized workflow compiled successfully")

return compiled
```

### Impact of Fix
- âœ… Workflow will compile successfully in production
- âœ… No functional impact - metadata was only informational
- âœ… All core functionality preserved

### Deployment
This hotfix is being deployed immediately to restore production functionality.
