# Production Fixes Summary - July 21, 2025

## Issues Found in Production

1. **Sofia Speaking English** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Problem: Sofia was saying "Great! I need your email to send the calendar invite"
   - Cause: English example prompts in sofia_agent_v2_fixed.py
   - Fix: Replaced ALL English prompts with Spanish equivalents
   - Status: Pushed to GitHub, awaiting deployment

2. **Maria Repeating Questions** üîç INVESTIGATING
   - Problem: "¬øQu√© tipo de negocio tienes?" asked 5+ times
   - Possible Causes:
     - Intelligence layer not extracting "restaurante" properly
     - State not persisting between messages
     - Maria not checking extracted_data correctly
   - Next Steps: Need to analyze Maria's code and intelligence extraction

3. **Messages Marked "Unsuccessful"** ‚úÖ UNDERSTOOD
   - Cause: SMS not connected in GHL (not a code issue)
   - No fix needed for this

## What Was Fixed

### Sofia Language Fix (Commit: e156631)
```python
# Added Spanish-only instruction:
IMPORTANTE: Debes responder SIEMPRE en espa√±ol. NUNCA en ingl√©s.

# Replaced English examples:
"Great! I need your email..." ‚Üí "¬°Perfecto! Necesito tu correo electr√≥nico..."
"Perfect! To send you..." ‚Üí "¬°Excelente! Para enviarte el enlace..."
"Nice to meet you..." ‚Üí "Mucho gusto..."
"What's your name?" ‚Üí "¬øCu√°l es tu nombre?"
# And more...
```

## Still To Fix

### 1. Maria's Repeated Questions
Need to check:
- Is intelligence analyzer extracting "restaurante"?
- Is Maria reading extracted_data properly?
- Is state being saved to GHL custom fields?

### 2. Verify Deployment
After deployment, need to verify:
- Sofia responds in Spanish only
- Maria stops repeating questions
- Score progression works properly

## Testing After Deployment

```bash
# Test Sofia's Spanish
Send: "S√≠, confirmo el presupuesto"
Expected: Spanish response asking for email

# Test Maria's business extraction
Send: "Tengo un restaurante"
Expected: Should NOT ask for business type again
```

## Key Insight

The main issue was a **deployment synchronization problem**:
- Local code had fixes
- Production had older code with English prompts
- Tests passed locally but failed in production

This is why comprehensive local testing is crucial before deployment!
