# SQLite Checkpoint Implementation Summary

## Current Status
We've implemented AsyncSqliteSaver for persistent checkpointing, but the implementation needs to be deployed carefully due to the async context manager requirements.

## What Was Done

### 1. Dependencies Added
- `aiosqlite>=0.19.0` 
- `langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite>=2.0.10`

### 2. Workflow Updated
- Changed from `MemorySaver` to `AsyncSqliteSaver`
- Added checkpoint loading logic with debug messages
- Ensured consistent thread_id using `contact-{contact_id}`

### 3. Key Code Changes

```python
# Import change
from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite.aio import AsyncSqliteSaver

# In run_workflow:
async with AsyncSqliteSaver.from_conn_string(checkpoint_db) as checkpointer:
    # Load existing checkpoint
    checkpoint_tuple = await checkpointer.aget(config)
    
    # Compile and run workflow with checkpointer
    workflow = workflow_graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    result = await workflow.ainvoke(initial_state, config=config)
```

## The Problem Being Solved
- **Before**: MemorySaver loses all data between webhook calls
- **After**: SQLite persists conversation history to disk

## Expected Behavior
1. First message: Creates checkpoint in SQLite
2. "Si" response: Loads history, understands context
3. Conversation continues with full history

## Deployment Considerations

### Option 1: Direct Deployment (Current Implementation)
- The workflow creates checkpointer within async context for each request
- Safe but creates new context each time
- Database file persists between calls

### Option 2: Persistent Checkpointer (Future Enhancement)
- Create a connection pool for SQLite
- Reuse checkpointer across requests
- Better performance but more complex

## Testing Results
- SQLite database file is created successfully
- Checkpoint loading logic is in place
- Ready for production testing

## Next Steps
1. Deploy current implementation
2. Monitor logs for checkpoint loading messages:
   - `âœ… Loaded X messages from SQLite`
   - `ðŸ†• No checkpoint in SQLite - new conversation`
3. Verify conversation continuity in production

## Files Modified
- `requirements.txt` - Added SQLite dependencies
- `app/workflow.py` - Implemented AsyncSqliteSaver
- `app/agents/receptionist_checkpoint_aware.py` - Created for better state handling

## Success Metrics
- No more "Hola" on "Si" responses
- Conversation history preserved
- `checkpoints.db` file exists and grows
- Context maintained across messages
