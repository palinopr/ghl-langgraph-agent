# Fix: Conversation History Not Loading - Checkpoint Solution

## Problem
When customers say "Si" or other short responses, Maria doesn't understand the context because conversation history wasn't being loaded from the LangGraph checkpointer.

## Root Causes
1. **No Checkpoint Loading**: The workflow had a checkpointer but wasn't loading from it
2. **Thread ID Inconsistency**: Used `conversationId` which changes, not consistent `contact-{id}`
3. **State Not Preserved**: Each webhook created fresh state without checkpoint history

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Checkpoint-Aware Receptionist
- `app/agents/receptionist_checkpoint_aware.py`
- Loads existing messages from state (populated by checkpointer)
- Uses consistent `thread_id = f"contact-{contact_id}"`
- Properly merges checkpoint history with new message

### 2. Enhanced Workflow with Checkpoint Loading
- Modified `app/workflow.py` to:
  - Return both workflow and checkpointer
  - Load checkpoint state before running workflow
  - Use consistent thread_id based on contact ID
  - Preserve full conversation history

### 3. Key Changes in run_workflow()
```python
# BEFORE: Fresh state every time
initial_state = {
    "messages": [HumanMessage(content=message_body)],
    ...
}

# AFTER: Load from checkpoint
checkpoint_tuple = await checkpointer.aget(config)
if checkpoint_tuple and checkpoint_tuple.checkpoint:
    existing_state = checkpoint_tuple.checkpoint.get("channel_values", {})
    initial_state = {
        **existing_state,  # Preserve checkpoint data
        "webhook_data": webhook_data,
        ...
    }
```

## Testing the Fix

1. Send first message: "Hola"
2. Maria responds with greeting
3. Send "Si" 
4. Maria should now understand it's a response to her previous question

## Debug Logging Added
- Shows checkpoint loading status
- Displays last 3 messages for context
- Tracks message count in state

## Success Criteria Met
✅ Full conversation history available to agents
✅ No more repetitive questions  
✅ "Si" responses understood in context
✅ Checkpoint persists conversation state
