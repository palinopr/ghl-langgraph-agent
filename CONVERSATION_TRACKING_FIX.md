# Conversation Tracking & Repetition Fix

## Issues Found
1. Agents were repeating greetings because they couldn't detect their own previous messages
2. No clear understanding of conversation stage/progress
3. Agents asking for information already provided
4. Generic responses instead of context-specific ones

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Smart Conversation Analyzer (`analyze_conversation_state`)
Added comprehensive conversation tracking that detects:
- **Greeting Status**: Whether agent has already greeted (checks ANY AI message content)
- **Exchange Count**: How many customer messages received
- **Topics Discussed**: What info has been covered (business_type, problem, email, name)
- **Pending Info**: What still needs to be collected
- **Conversation Stage**: discovery → qualification → solution_presentation → closing_for_demo

### 2. Enhanced Context Detection
- Smart router now has fallback detection for business keywords
- Extracts business_type from phrases like "tengo un restaurante"
- Extracts goals from phrases like "perdiendo clientes"
- Logs all extracted data for debugging

### 3. Stage-Based Prompting
Maria now receives:
```
📍 CONVERSATION STAGE: SOLUTION_PRESENTATION
🔄 CONVERSATION STATUS: ONGOING - Skip greeting
💬 EXCHANGES SO FAR: 3
✅ ALREADY DISCUSSED: business_type, specific_problem
❓ STILL NEED: name, email
```

### 4. Benefits
- **No More Repeated Greetings**: Agent knows if greeting already happened
- **Smart Questions**: Only asks for missing information
- **Context Awareness**: Understands restaurant vs clinic vs store context
- **Progress Tracking**: Knows exactly where in the sales flow they are

## Test Results
All conversation tracking tests pass:
- ✅ Empty conversation detection
- ✅ First message analysis
- ✅ Greeting detection (even without agent names)
- ✅ Multi-exchange tracking
- ✅ Information extraction tracking
- ✅ Stage progression

## Next Steps
- Apply same tracking to Carlos and Sofia agents
- Add more sophisticated stage detection
- Track objections and concerns
- Monitor demo booking attempts
